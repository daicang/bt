# BT
A simple B+Tree key-value db

### Inspired by

[BTree](https://github.com/google/btree) for B-Tree implementation
[BoltDB](https://github.com/boltdb/bolt) for using mmap

### TODO

- [x] Finish btree indexing
- [x] Finish btree deleting logic
- [ ] Use b+tree instead of b-tree
- [ ] Implement mmap
